[Music]
there's been a discovery
it was announced yesterday that
indicates there's
potentially new physics that we we don't
know of
i know it's a big statement fermilab in
illinois is where this experiment was
done
have you ever heard of um the standard
model
any have you ever seen anything that
looks like this yeah this
is basically all the particles that we
know of
and all the forces that we know of
electrons protons everything they make
over our atoms
there's evidence from this experiment
that there's maybe something beyond that
this is huge because the standard model
has been like
a work of decades it comes from theory
and experimentation
and one of the last particles that we
that we had theorized from the standard
model and then discovered was the higgs
boson which was that massive experiment
at cern
so for there to not even be theorized
particles
you know what i mean like it's not even
in our theory it's just evidence
that there's something beyond our theory
beyond our theory and beyond
anything we've ever seen so that is what
this announcement
means or potentially means so i say
potentially because
what the experiment was that was just
announced it's not
precise enough for it to be considered
a big scientific announcement okay so
what it is is
very complicated have you ever heard of
a muon
no great okay we've heard of electrons
they're in these terrible models of
atoms there are other particles that
are not as common there are actually a
lot of them for example the higgs boson
another example is neutrinos and another
example is the muon and the muon
is oh the mion was discovered in 1936
because they were looking at the way
that electrons move in a magnetic field
and then they see another particle come
through and it has a much
wider arc and they're like what the heck
is that so have you ever heard that
if you've got just a uniform magnetic
field and you shoot a charged particle
through it it'll curve
have you heard of this okay does it make
sense
okay good i'm glad i asked what is
another example of this happening
oh in cern the reason that particles go
around and around
is because they're charged particles and
they're going around in these big
magnetic fields and it makes them curve
and then when they collide and all this
stuff comes off they're watching
how they curve in a magnetic field
that's why you see all these spiral
lines coming off of the collision
because if a particle has a negative or
a positive charge
it'll curve one way or the other way in
a magnetic field
if it doesn't have a charge at all like
a neutron it just goes straight so
you'll see those spirals
and then you'll see the straight lines
so there's these guys and then they see
another particle come through and it has
a much wider arc
much wider means that it has more mass
so they
found this particle they're like what is
that turns out it is
just like the electrons a lot of people
call it the cousin to the electron but
it has 207 times
the mass oh so that's what they're just
they discovered they discovered the new
one if you had a bunch of muons
instead of electrons in your atoms you
would be way heavier i don't know how
much heavier
um okay so the measurement that was just
made
was that oh this is the part where it's
gonna get really tricky you know how
a top that's spinning will kind of
wobble around
if the top were in space it wouldn't do
that
it would just spin it wouldn't wobble
the reason that it's wobbling is because
it's spinning in a gravitational field
and gravity is having an effect on the
top and making it
wobble can you accept that i'm good
because i don't want to go in similarly
there's another really
complicated property of particles called
spin
it's not like the particle is actually
spinning it's just a property
but when you put a particle with
magnetic magnetic spin in a magnetic
field
it'll wobble in the similar way the
amount that it would wobble is something
that we can predict say that the amount
of wobble
is supposed to be two the amount of the
amount it's supposed to wobble is called
the g factor
and the theoretical number is supposed
to be two for the new one
now there's something else weird that
we've theorized which is that
the wobble should also be affected by
something that people call quantum foam
have you heard
of the idea that there are constantly
particles popping in and out of
existence in the vacuum
of space yeah okay so those particles
popping in and out
when that happens they can interact with
a particle
of a real particle that exists like a
muon
and then they can affect that wobble i
know that this is getting to the point
where it's like okay what is the point
of all of this
we've got quantum foam affecting the
wobble but we're almost there and we
have a number for that and it's like
it's close to the two it's like two
point two point zero zero and then
there's this
added correction two three three one
eight three six two
zero eight six and eight six in
parenthesis for the error
now that's obviously a very precise
theoretical
measurement 12 digits of precision that
we think we
know the theoretic theoretical amount of
the effect of the wobble from the
quantum foam
they did a measurement of the g factor
of the amount of wobble
and they saw it didn't match the
theoretical number so it didn't match it
by
um in the last four digits of that
eleven digit you saw instead of three
six two zero you saw
four one two two so does this already
mean that the foam is not causing it
no it doesn't mean that the foam is not
causing it it means that
it means that there's probably particles
that we don't know of
or forces we don't know of because we
have such a precise idea of what how the
wobble should change based off of known
particles
and how we know they pop up into
existence so
if we measure something different most
likely it must be that the physics is
different
so you brought us in here to tell us
after all this
that there's more we don't know
[Laughter]
the newest discovery in physics we might
know less
than we thought but it's it's the way
that we don't know more that's
important
it's not like oh we don't know what
happened before the big bang
it's like no we're seeing evidence for
something specific to
go look for right here is the moment
when physicists are like
oh my god let's go look for new
particles let's go look for new
forces okay maybe it's not that
important to you to go look for new
particles but have you seen cern
it's huge like that entire experiment
was looking for
one new particle
i know i know like there's nothing
specific to look for yet
because it doesn't fit our theories like
when we looked for the higgs boson it
was
part of the standard model theory yeah
it was like there's the higgs right
there
here's a grayed out box of a particle we
have a theory for
and then we discovered it and like boop
fill that in with the color
but we're seeing an anomaly we're seeing
something act differently than
we ever predicted before it's like
winning at bingo and then someone's like
look
a new alphabet or it's like winning at
bingo and then you get another bingo
card
bingo plus that's pretty crazy it
doesn't fit the standard model
i know so it could be new particles new
forces or something
wrong about our current theory but we
know so much about our current theory
and so many of our
very expensive very precise experiments
have verified what we know
so for the idea that some of it to be
wrong is almost as
inconceivable as for there to be new
particles and new
theories which is also inconceivable at
this point but
yeah it's exciting how come they're
confident there's something
something really big to find why can't
it just something that haven't thought
of like anything magnetic on earth
like where we are placed in the galaxy
so one reason that they're confident
about this result is that
it was done before in 2001 so it was
originally done in brookhaven national
labs
in 2001 and it was such a big result at
the time that they're like we have to
verify this
and so they took the big old magnet a
big superconducting magnet 50 foot in
diameter
here it is see that red thing that's the
magnet arriving
at fermilab to a big party and a big
celebration
because it was transported 3 200 miles
to upgrade it i went to fermi lab in
2016
and the only picture i took besides like
oh there's a pretty view down the
building was
of this diagram that shows the path that
the magnet took
okay so this is not this is not
technically a discovery yet and the
reason i said that is because you need a
certain amount of
certainty you need a certain certainty
to consider a scientific announcement as
is like an actual discovery
and you need it um to be something
called five sigma
which is just like a statistical amount
the exciting thing is that they verified
a result from 2001.
but again normally and rightfully
five sigma is the amount of certainty
that you usually need to make this
to make this type of announcement so
since they're only at 4.2 sigma
scientists are being careful and saying
like yes this is exciting
we verified a result from a previous
experiment so that's promising
but it's not promising enough because we
don't have enough certainty well they're
going to keep it here and they're going
to upgrade the experiment
for future runs and get get more
precision
the chance that this this measurement is
a random fluctuation like a random
statistical error
in the in the measurement is one in
forty thousand
like not enough that i would bet my life
on but
that's usually so small or so big but
that's like weirdly a normal number
usually talking about like the billions
or the quantum right right right right
we know enough of that to make a good
enough prediction of
what the what the change in this little
wobble
the g factor should be and and
we see something different
that's it it's a big announcement
yay okay and cut
[Music]
so actually when i was doing my
experiment looking for dark matter in
college
when we first turned it on one of the
first things we saw was a muon
pi the person running the experiment was
like oh see that blip that signal that's
a muon we just
detected these cosmic ray muons which
are these particles raining down
what does it use to detect we were
making a detector that was looking for
actually neutrons all these are just
different particles
and the device was like this i'm making
it this big but it's actually like i
don't know what's here to hear it like
10 feet
um this big chamber full of this fluid
called scintillator
it's a really cool fluid because if you
just like barely look in there you see a
little glow
so a particle will come through this
scintillator and they'll cause it to
glow
along the path um and then we had
detectors on either end that would
capture the light and so you'd see
oh a particle came through because we
got a little bit of blip of light which
meant that something came through a
scintillator that's how the
detector worked so we turned it on and
we were like we got a little flash of
light
that's probably a new one we just saw a
cosmic ray muon any more questions
okay the other really cool thing that
muons were used for
was to verify one of the predictions of
special relativity from einstein
specifically time dilation and this was
a long time ago
1941. have you heard of time dilation
the basic idea
is that if we were moving really fast
like if i was jetting through
the universe then time would tick slower
for me which is cool
there's a lot i mean there's a lot more
to it ah basically time ticks
differently depending on whether you're
moving or not
if you went and traveled around the
earth a bunch of times in a really fast
rocket ship and came back
you would have aged less than i would
have aged that was
a prediction of relativity but not
verified
until later and one of the the
verifications was this really cool
experiment the thing about
muons is that they they don't live very
long they have
a mean lifetime of 2.2 microseconds
but there are a lot of them constantly
raining down on us because a lot of them
are produced
when cosmic rays come from the universe
and they hit our atmosphere
imagine you can measure how many muons
there are like go up on top of a hill
and measure how many are coming through
a little area and then go down to the
bottom of the mountain and you know
how fast these muons are supposed to
decay so you should go to the bottom and
you should only see a certain number
because
the rest of them should have decayed but
what happened is they saw
more at the bottom than they should have
more were surviving
but what that means is that because
these muons are going so fast
time is ticking slower for them they're
actually not decaying because they
haven't reached that mean lifetime so
that was a verification
of this idea of relativity does that
make sense
